# TrueNamer
A wicked SandWolff production

Truename is an environmental puzzle game where all objects are made up of adjectives. You have the power to rip these adjectives off any object, and add them to others. Use this power to navigate the world, and get back your hat (among other super important things.)

Created with Unity, 3DS Max, Photoshop, and C#
